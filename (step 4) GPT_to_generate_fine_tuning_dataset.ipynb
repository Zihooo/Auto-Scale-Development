        "1. **Task Overview**\n",
        "   - You need to create 120 brief statements (each one sentence, and within 20 words) related to a concept called *Interpersonal Distrust*.\n",
        "   - Interpersonal Distrust is An expectation of harmful, hostile, or other negative outcomes in interactions with another person, accompanied by negative affect and an intention to take protective actions based on these expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dimensions of Interpersonal Distrust**\n",
        "   - **Cognitive**: Rational beliefs or expectations about another party’s untrustworthiness, specifying in what respects and under which circumstances distrust may arise.\n",
        "   - **Behavioral**: The unwillingness or avoidance of future interactions or risk-taking actions based on these negative expectations and feelings toward the other person.\n",
        "   - **Affective**: Negative emotions directed at the distrusted person.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Specific Instructions**\n",
        "   - You must produce exactly 120 statements, each belonging to one of the three dimensions above (*Cognitive*, *Behavioral*, or *Affective*).\n",
        "   - Each statement must be no longer than 20 words and should relate clearly to its assigned dimension.\n",
        "   - Provide each statement on a new line.\n",
        "   - Create two columns:\n",
        "     1. The first column contains the statement.\n",
        "     2. The second column identifies the *target dimension* of that statement (i.e., *Cognitive*, *Behavioral*, or *Affective*).\n",

        "   - Try to avoid generate highly similar statements.\n",
        "   - Generate 40 statements for each dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Formatting Requirements**\n",
        "   - Output should be organized in two columns (statement, target dimension).\n",
        "   - Each statement must be unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Examples (Do Not Copy Exactly)**\n",
        "   - Cognitive: “This person would behave in a deceptive and fraudulent way.”,\"I am suspicious of the way this person will act in the future.\", \"This person would use me for his/her own benefits.\"\n",
        "   - Behavioral: “I find it necessary to be cautious with this person.”,\"I will protect myself from being taken advantage of by this person.\",\"I will not count on this person for important things.\"\n",
